        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work revolutionized the understanding of time, space, gravity, and the universe. He is best known for his famous equation, <em>E = mc²</em>, which expresses the equivalence of energy and mass.</p>
        <p>Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed an early interest in mathematics and science. He graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1900 and initially worked in a patent office in Bern. It was during this time that he developed his groundbreaking ideas in theoretical physics, including the special theory of relativity in 1905.</p>
        <p>Einstein’s career took off in the academic world after his theories gained international attention. In 1915, he completed his general theory of relativity, which described how gravity works in the context of space-time. His predictions were later confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919, which made him a global celebrity.</p>
        <p>In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Einstein was an outspoken advocate for peace, civil rights, and democracy. He fled Germany in 1933 after Adolf Hitler came to power, eventually settling in the United States. Einstein became a U.S. citizen in 1940 and spent his later years working on problems such as the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, as well as pursuing his unified field theory. He passed away in 1955 at the age of 76.</p>
        <p>Throughout his life, Einstein remained humble, often stating that his success was a result of his constant curiosity and determination. His contributions to science, philosophy, and human rights continue to inspire people worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Key Contributions to Science</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein’s contributions extend far beyond his most famous equation. Some of his key achievements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Theory of Relativity</strong>: Revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, explaining how mass distorts space-time and affects the motion of objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Photoelectric Effect</strong>: His explanation of the photoelectric effect helped establish the quantum theory, showing that light behaves as both a wave and a particle.</li>
            <li><strong>Bose-Einstein Condensate</strong>: A state of matter predicted by Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose, observed experimentally in 1995, where particles act as a single quantum entity.</li>
            <li><strong>Unified Field Theory</strong>: Though never fully realized, Einstein spent the later years of his life attempting to create a theory that could unify the forces of gravity and electromagnetism.</li>
        </ul>
